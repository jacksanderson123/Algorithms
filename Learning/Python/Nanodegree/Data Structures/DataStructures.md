Properties of an Array

- There is a collection of itmes
- The items have an order to them (an Index)
  - When an array is created it's given an inital size
    - number of elements it can hold and how large the elements are
    - In a contigious block (next to each other in memory) maths can be used to work out the indexs
- Elements are the same size in memory

An example the first element in an array is location and elements are 8 bytes long, the start of the first element will be at
start memory location: 0
End memory location: 0 + 8 = 8
This can be used to calculate where in memory the elements are
